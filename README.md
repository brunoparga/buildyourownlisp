# buildyourownlisp

Code from [buildyourownlisp.com]. I've decided to name my language Lye. The course uses "lispy", so I had chosen the `.ly` file extension; but apparently that is already taken by a sheet music program. So yeah, I'm just adding the -e at the end and making the name of my language kinda confusing.
